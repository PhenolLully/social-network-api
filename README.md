What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

First a github repository needs to be created make sure it has a README.md file, then clone the repository and paste it in your Week 4 folder. Then open the developer folder in the class repository and copy the material inside the folder into the repository folder. Then you can continue work on the assignment.
